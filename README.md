###To build

clone the project cd into the project directory

```
$ cd MyApp
$ sencha app build 
```

This should build the XCode Project and then you can run the project from there.

Alternatively, *IF* everything is configured properly, you should be able to run the emulator with this command


```
$ sencha app build -run native
```

However it did not work for me.
